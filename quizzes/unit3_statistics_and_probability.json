    {
      "question": "What is the mean of the numbers \\( 4, 8, 12, 16 \\)?",
      "options": ["10", "12", "14", "15"],
      "answer": [1],
      "explanation": "The mean is calculated by summing the numbers and dividing by the count: \\( \\frac{40}{4} = 12 \\).",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a measure of central tendency?",
      "options": ["Mean", "Variance", "Standard Deviation", "Probability"],
      "answer": [0],
      "explanation": "Mean is a measure of central tendency, representing the average value of a dataset.",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the mode of the dataset \\( 3, 7, 3, 9, 3, 5 \\)?",
      "options": ["3", "7", "9", "5"],
      "answer": [0],
      "explanation": "The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a dataset. Here, 3 appears three times.",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die?",
      "options": ["\\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)", "\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)", "\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)", "\\( \\frac{1}{12} \\)"],
      "answer": [0],
      "explanation": "Each side of a six-sided die has an equal chance, so the probability of rolling a 6 is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of a discrete random variable?",
      "options": ["Height of students", "Number of books in a library", "Temperature in a city", "Time taken to complete a task"],
      "answer": [1],
      "explanation": "A discrete variable has specific countable outcomes, like number of books.",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the median of the dataset \\( 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 \\)?",
      "options": ["10", "15", "20", "25"],
      "answer": [1],
      "explanation": "The median is the middle value of the ordered dataset. Here, it's 15.",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the variance of the dataset \\( 2, 4, 6, 8 \\)?",
      "options": ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
      "answer": [0],
      "explanation": "Mean is 5. Variance is \\( \\frac{(2-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (6-5)^2 + (8-5)^2}{4} = 5 \\).",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads?",
      "options": ["\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)", "\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)", "\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)", "\\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)"],
      "answer": [0],
      "explanation": "A coin has two equally likely outcomes, so the probability of heads is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which graph is best suited to show frequencies of categories?",
      "options": ["Pie Chart", "Bar Graph", "Line Graph", "Histogram"],
      "answer": [1],
      "explanation": "Bar graphs are excellent for representing the frequency of distinct categories.",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the interquartile range (IQR) of \\( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \\)?",
      "options": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
      "answer": [1],
      "explanation": "Q1 = 3, Q3 = 7, so IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 4.",
      "type": "singleSelect"
    }
  ]
